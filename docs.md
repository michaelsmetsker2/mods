# Ballionaire API Mod Docs

Up-to-date as of Ballionaire `v1.0.25`

# Overview

## Golden Rule

Documents can get stale, so please use `examples/mod.lua` as the source of truth if you find a contradiction between the docs and the examples :)

## Language / Runtime

Ballionaire's mods use Lua, powered by the [MoonSharp interpreter](https://www.moonsharp.org/). Please check out the MoonSharp FAQ for differences between MoonSharp's dialect of Lua and vanilla Lua. For the most part, there shouldn't be any practical differences.

## Sandbox

The Lua environment is heavily sandboxed. You'll have access to `print`, `string`, `math`, and `table` APIs, but not much else. Importantly, `require` and variations of `load` are not supported; your mod must reside entirely in a single `mod.lua` file.

I'll be working to support interactions betwene mods and mult-file mods in the future, but want to keep things simple for v1.0.

## Debugging

Any `print` calls you make will end up in the file `%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\ballionaire\logs\godot.log`. You can tail that file, open it in VS code, whatever, and use that to print-debug. Note: I don't think Godot flushes the log file aggressively, so there might be tiny bits of lag in print statements showing up in the log.

## How to Structure Your Mod

The game will scan and load mods once, at startup. If you need to make changes to your mod, you'll need to restart the game. If you want to unload mods, you'll need to restart the game.

Each Mod should live in its own directory, and must contain both a `mod.ini` and `mod.lua` file. Any image files used by the mode can also live in that directory. Those images can be referred to via a relative path in the mod code.

```
my_mod\              (this is the mod's id)
  mod.ini
  mod.lua
  trigger.png
  other_trigger.png
```

Mods are first loaded from the Steam workshop, e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\2667120`. Each workship item in that directory will be examined for a mod.lua file.

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\2667120
  3355979752\          (this is the mod's id)
    mod.ini
    mod.lua
    trigger.png
    other_trigger.png
```

Mods are also loaded from the `mods\` directory of the game's working directory (on Steam, where the game is installed). Ballionaire will look at eash subdirectory directly under `mods\` and check for a `mod.lua` file.

Mods are identified by the name of the directory they're in. If the mod loader detects two mods with same id, it will complain.

## mod.ini

The `mod.ini` file contains the basics of identifying your mod: the mod's name, the author's name, a description of the mod, an an icon representing the mod. All of this information will be display in-game in the Mods tab as well as in the Custom Run or Lab pages.

The `version` field is especially important. If you make breaking changes to your mod, such as removing content, or changing what the save/load structure is for a piece of content, you need to bump your mod's version up by 1. When the game sees a mod's version change, it will automatically cancel any in-progress run that was using the earlier version of the mod. To keep this simple, we recommend simply increasing your versio by 1 every time you publish a change to your mod.

```
[mod]
version = 1
name = "Examples"
author = "newobject"
about = "Mod API Examples"
texture = "computer.png"
```

## mod.lua

See `examples/mod.lua` for an example of how to define the content of your mod. A basic mod will typically only have top-level calls to definition functions like `define_starter_pack`, `define_boon`, etc. `mod.lua` itself is executed when the application starts, not when a run starts, so you generally don't want any gameplay logic executing at the top level of the file, because there won't be any "game" at that time.

## exports.txt

Several global values are made available to your mod, to allow you to refer to built-in content from the core game. These are all listed in `exports.txt` - the symbols there are verbatim how to refer to things, e.g. to refer to a Butterfly you would use `triggers.butterfly`.

The exports can and will change as the game receives updates. We'll try to make sure these changes are always backwards compatible, but we can't make any guarantees that such changes **won't** occur.

# Framework

The Ballionaire mod API is broken down into two sections: definition functions that run at game load time for defining your mod and content such as triggers, and game functions that run at game play time, for interacting with the gameplay and making things happen!
top level of `mod.lua`

### `define_ball_type`

Call this function at the top level of `mod.lua` to define a new ball type

`define_ball_type(options)`

**Arguments**

- `options` (`table`, required)
  - `id` (`number`, required): a unique ball type id in _this_ `mod.lua` file. Recommended to start at 1 and simply count up. `Do not` renumber ball types; the save system is based around maintaining consistent ids across versions.
  - `name` (`string`, required) The visible name of the ball. Should be globally unique, to prevent confusion
  - `texture` ([Texture](#texture), required): a texture for this ball.
  - `texture_left` ([Texture](#texture), required): a texture for this ball (left half). Should be 360x360 and centered.

**Returns**

[TriggerDraft](#triggerdraft)

# Helpers

`color(color, str)`

This function will color the given string `str` by the given color in markup text. Recommend that you only use this in boon and trigger descriptions.

- `color`: one of `"yellow"`, `"orange"`, `"blue"`, `"red"`, `"green"`, `"white"`, or a value that will be treated as html rgb (e.g. `"#f020a0"`)
- `str`: the text to color

"Better Battery" trigger in `examples/mod.lua` shows an example use of this.

# Data Types

## API

### Read-Only Properties

- `current_tribute` - (number) the current tribute number, 1-based.
- `money` - (number) current amount of money earned this tribute.
- `money_goal` - (number) current money goal (tribute amount).
- `remaining_drops` - (number) how many drops are left before the tribute must be satisfied.

## Mult

Mult is a bit complicated in Ballionaire. Let's start backwards, with how money is earned:

`Earnings = Base x Mult x XMult`

Every trigger starts with some Base earning, a Mult of 1.0, and an XMult of 1.0. When a trigger gains Mult, it adds to the existing Mult, and when it gains XMult, it multiplies into the existing XMult.

This isn't too dissimilar from what you might be used to in other games. However, mult has two more concepts in Ballionaire that you must understand: managed mult/xmult and unmanaged mult/xmult.

Unmanaged mult/xmult is managed via the `gain_mult` and `gain_xmult` APIs. This permanently changes a trigger's Mult and XMult (by adding more Mult or multiplying more XMult). A trigger's internal Mult and XMult are saved when continuing the game. The gain of mult is not attributed to any source, and it will never be lost by that trigger. Use for this mult effects that are permanent in nature, e.g. the way that Vacancy Sign works, for example.

Managed mult/xmult controlled via the `set_managed_mult`, `clear_managed_mult`, `set_managed_xmult`, and `clear_managed_xmult` APIs. These mults are only temporarily provided by another source (trigger or boon). The provider is responsible for keeping track of the mults, and applying them, even on continuing a saved game. If the provider is destroyed/removed, the mult is automatically cleared. These APIs are _NOT_ cumulative, you can simply set, or clear, a value. Each trigger can track exaclty. one mult and xmult value from each source. An example of this kind of managed mult is Greenhouse, or Amethyst.

In summary, mult actually works as:

`Earnings = Base x (Unmanaged Mult + Sum of All Managed Mults) x (Unamanged XMult X Product Of All Managed XMults)`

See `examples/mod.lua` "Lucky Foot" and "Louder Whistle" for examples of unmanaged mults and managed mults (respectively).

## Mixins

Mixins are the mechanism by which common functionality can easily be bestowed upon a Trigger. See [API](#api) for details on how install a Mixin; Mixins should typically be installed unconditionally in the `on_place` callback. There is no way to uninstall a Mixin from a Trigger. Mixins handle saving/loading their own state.

Ballionaire currently supports six types of mixins: `ager`, `holder`, `limited`, `attackable`, `shy`, and `value`.

### Ager

Represents a Trigger that ages over time. This Mixin will give the Trigger a counter that displays its current age.

- `age` (`number`) - current age of this Trigger
- `change_age_by` (`function`) - increase or decrease the age of this trigger
  - arguments :
    - `amount` (`number`) - amount to change the age by
- `change_age_by` (`function`) - increase or decrease the age of this trigger
  - arguments :
    - `amount` (`number`) - amount to change the age by
- `change_age_gain_by` (`function`) - age again is basically a multiplier on any age changes. it starts at 1.
  - arguments :
    - `amount` (`number`) - amount to change the age gain by

### Attackable

Represents a Trigger that can be damaged by balls. The Trigger is responsible for implementing whatever it means to be "exhausted" (run out of health). See `examples/mod.lua` `derpy_dragon` definition for examples.

- `health` (`number`, readonly) - amount of remaining health
- `max_health` (`number`, readwrite) - the attackable's max health
- `damage` (`function`) - cause damage to the trigger
  - arguments :
    - ([Ball](#ball)) - the ball if any which caused the damage
    - (number) - the amount of damage to do. typically want to consult the ball for this, e.g. `e.ball.damage_for(e.self)`

### Holder

Represents a Trigger that "holds" things like balls, carryables, or other abstract concepts. This Mixin will give the Trigger a counter that displays the number of items currently held.

- `amount` (`number`) - current amount of held things
- `deposit` (`function`) - add to the held amount in this Holder
  - arguments :
    - `ball` (`number`) -
    - `amount` (`number`) - amount to deposit in the Holder
- `withdraw` (`function`) - remove fromt he held amount in the Holder
  - arguments :
    - `amount` (`number`) - amount to withdraw from the Holder
- `clear` (`function`) - reset the held count to zero.
  - arugments :
    - (none)

### Limited

Represents a Trigger that has a limited amount of uses. Triggers are responsible for consuming their own charges, and implementing whatever it means to run out of charges. Not all Triggers are destroyed when running out of charges, so this Mixin does not handle that functionality. This Mixin will give the Trigger a counter that displays the number of charges remaining.

- `charges` (`number`) - current amount of remaining charges.
- `max_charges` (`number`) - max charges this limited trigger can hold.
- `change_charges_by` (`function`) - increase or decrease the remaining charges of this Trigger
  - arguments :
    - `amount` (`number`) - amount to change the charges by

## Objects

### Ball

- `Ball` (`userdata`)
  - `class` (`string`, readonly) - `"ball"`
  - `position` ([Vector2](#vector2), readonly) - the global position of this Ball.
  - `linear_velocity` ([Vector2](#vector2), readonly) - the linear velocity of this Ball.
  - `type` ([BallType](#balls), readonly) - the type of the Ball.
  - `xmult` (number, readwrite) - the ball's earning multiplier (xmult). Applied to any money it causes to be earned. Starts at 1.0.

### BallType

- `BallType` (`userdata`)
  - `class` (`string`, readonly) - `"balltype"`
  - `name` (`string`, readonly)
  - `plural_name` (`string`, readonly)
  - `rich_name` (`string`, required) the name as above, with markup for colored text.
  - `rich_plural_name` (`string`, required) the name as above, with markup for colored text.

See the `exports.txt` file for a list of all built-in BallTypes.

### Boon

- `Boon` (`userdata`)
  - `class` (`string`, readonly) - `"boon"`
  - `def` ([BoonDef](#boondef), readonly) - the BoonDef for this Boon.

### BoonDef

- `BoonDef` (`userdata`)
  - `class` (`string`, readonly) - `"boondef"`
  - `name` (`string`, readonly)
  - `rich_name` (`string`, required) the name as above, with markup for colored text.
  - `texture` ([Texture](#texture), readonly)

See the `exports.txt` file for a list of all built-in Boon definitions. So for example you can refer to the Correctional Fluid boon by `boons.correctional_fluid`

### Concept

A `Concept` is an umbrella of many things; every [TriggerDef](#triggerdef) or [BoonDef](#boondef) is a concept. Each [Trait](#trait) is a concept.

### Earn

- `Earn` (`userdata`)
  - `base` (`number`, readonly) - the earning base
  - `mult` (`number`, readonly) - the earning overall multiplier (mult times xmult; see below)
  - `scalar` (`number`, readonly) - the total value earned `base * mult` (mult times xmult)
  - `gain_mult` (`function`, args: `number`) - increase mult (additive)
  - `gain_xmult` (`function`, args: `number`) - increase the xmult (multiplicative)

Earning is based on a mult/xmult model:

`(1.0 + mult) * xmult`

For example, given an Earn object `earn`, with Base: 800, Mult: 1.0

If you then call

`earn.gain_mult(0.25)`

`earn.gain_xmult(2)`

`earn.gain_mult(0.25)`

The Earn object will now have an internal mult of `0.5`, an xmult of `2.0`. Plugging into the overall Mult formula: `(1.0 + 0.5) * 2.0` - the total Mult is `3.0`.

### Slot

- `Slot` (`userdata`)
  - `class` (`string`, readonly) - `"slot"`
  - `id` (`number`, readonly) - just a numeric identifier for the slot. Has no inherent meaning, just to help debugging.
  - `position` ([Vector2](#vector2), readonly) - the global position of this slot.
  - `is_bottom_row` (`boolean`, readonly) - is the slot part of the bottom row
  - `is_top_row` (`boolean`, readonly) - is the slot part of the top row

### Trait

- `Trait` (`userdata`)
  - `class` (`string`, readonly) - `"trait"`
  - `name` (`string`, readonly) - the displayable name of the trait.
  - `rich_name` (`string`, required) the name as above, with markup for colored text.

There's also a global object, named `traits`, that has all the built-in traits defined on it, e.g. `traits.spawner`. The existing built-in traits are `ager`, `animal`, `attackable`, `hat`, `holder`, `carryable`, `chain`, `cluster`, `plant`, `limited`, `food`, `meal`, `ingredient`, `shy`, `mover`, `secret`, `obstacle`, `one_shot`, `permanent`, `spawner`, `scroll`, `treasure`, `unique`, `vehicle`, and `weapon`.

### TriggerDef

- `TriggerDef` (`userdata`)
  - `class` (`string`, readonly) - `"triggerdef"`
  - `name` (`string`, readonly)
  - `rich_name` (`string`, required) the name as above, with markup for colored text.
  - `texture` ([Texture](#texture), readonly)
  - `traits` (`table` where keys are [Trait](#trait) objects, readonly)

See the `exports.txt` file for a list of all built-in Trigger definitions. So for example you can refer to the pizza trigger by `triggers.pizza`

### TriggerDraft

- `TriggerDraft` (`userdata`)
  - `class` (`string`, readonly) - `"triggerdraft"`
  - `is_standard` (`boolean`, readonly) - true if this draft is the "standard trigger draft" that occurs after each drop.

### Trigger

- `Trigger` (`userdata`)
  - `class` (`string`, readonly) - `"trigger"`
  - `def` ([TriggerDef](#triggerdef), readonly) - the TriggerDef for this Trigger.
  - `position` ([Vector2](#vector2), readonly) - the global position of this trigger.
  - `slot` ([Slot](#slot), readonly) - the slot where the Trigger has been placed.
  - `total_mult` (`number`, readonly) - the total mult (mult\*xmult) currently on this trigger, including both gained and managed mults/xmults.
  - `as` (`function`, readonly) - returns the given [Mixin](#mixins), if installed in the Trigger.
    - arguments :
      - mixin (`string`, required) - the name of the mixin
    - returns :
      - [Mixin](#mixins) or `nil` (if mixin is not installed in the Trigger)

## Godot

### Texture

- `Texture` (`userdata`)

**As output _from_ the API**: An opaque userdata represented a Godot Texture. You can't do anything with it, other than pass it around. Look in the example mod to see how we repurpose a boon or trigger texture as an icon for our starter pack, e.g. `boons.zoo.texture`

**As input _to_ the API**: Either:

- An opaque userdata, as above
- _or_ if you supply a `string`, the game will attempt to load an imagee from disk at that path.

### Vector2

- `Vector2` (`userdata`)

This object is auto-bound to [Godot's Vector2](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html), so most of this documentation should apply.

## Future Improvements
